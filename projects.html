                <p>Project goal: Bringing school spirit to life</p>
                <br>
                <p>Project duration: November 2017 - August 2018</P>
                <br>
                <p>In the winter of 2017, four of my lifelong friends and I decided we wanted to design and create something that would help cultivate and display the strong community spirit that we grew up surrounded by. We were proud of the school system we belonged to, and we wanted to give back to the community that had always supported us.
                It was easy to notice that the exterior of our highschool did not quite exemplify the strong spirit that existed within the school, and we wanted to change that. Our plan: create an LED sign with our school logo that could act as a landmark when students enter the school and attend sporting events.  </p>

                <h2><strong>Request for Proposal</strong></h2>
                Our first plan of action was to seek approval from our school's Board of Education, and uncover any potential details or problems that may change the course of our project. We presented our idea and while we gained the immediate support from Adams, we were notified that all fundraising and project coordination would be completely in our hands.

                <h2><strong>Research</strong></h2>
                Upon obtaining approval from the school, we began looking into different mockups, potential outsourcing options, and outlining how we were going to fundraise for a sign that would surely cost thousands of dollars. While we recognized we would not have the ability to physically create the sign ourselves, we wanted to ensure that we found a company that would allow us to be engaged in the production process from start to finish.
