              <br>
              <p>Throughout the summer of 2021, I worked at <a href="https://credibly.com/" target="_blank">Credibly</a> as UX research intern. Credibly is a finance-tech lending company that leverages cutting-edge data science, technology, partner relations, and customer support to provide business owners with accelerated access to right-sized capital solutions. </p>
            <h2><strong>Outcome</strong></h2>
                <p>During my time at Credibly, I was exposed to many different in-house projects and as a result, I was able to gain valuable training in optimizing the customer's experience. Due to NDA, I currently cannot share all the specifics here, but these are some impacts that I made within the marketing team throughout my internship:</p>
